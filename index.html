            Supposedly, this text-formatting makes the paragraphs easier and
            faster to read, at least for some neuro-divergent people.

          <h1>Bionic text</h1>
          <p>
            Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
            Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they
            live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large
            language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
            supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic
            country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts
            it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of
            blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far
            World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because
            there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious
            Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her
            seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on
            the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a
            last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the
            headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the
            Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she
            continued her way. On her way she met a copy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it
            would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was
            left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind
            Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But
            nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long
            until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
            Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they
            abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t
            been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind
            the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia,
            there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
            right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small
            river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the
            necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which
            roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
