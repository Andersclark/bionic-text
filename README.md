## What is this nonsense?

I stumbled upon a tweet showing text where some letters of words where formatted differently to help the reader's brain infer words quicker and therefore making reading easier and faster (at least for some neuro-divergent people). This technology is called the bionic reading-method. I have no facts to back these claims, but gave the formatting a shot anyway!

## Conclusion

Unfortunately, I coudln't find a workable solution for styling a larger part than the initial letter of a word separately from the rest of the word. So ofcourse I resorted to Javascript - knowing well that this solution comes with it's own problems.
